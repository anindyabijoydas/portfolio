I am presently a PhD candidate at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I am currently working on the straggler issue in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor [**Aditya Ramamoorthy**](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). 

My research interests include-
  * Distributed computation
  * Deep machine learning
  * Signal Processing 
  * Quantum computation
