<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
I am currently working as a tenure-track assistant professor in [<span style="color: #00008B">**The University of Akron**</span>](https://www.uakron.edu/) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). 

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Purdue University working jointly with Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**David J. Love**</span>](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/) and Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**Christopher G. Brinton**</span>](https://www.cbrinton.net/) on federated learning and deep learning with applications in different areas of communications. 

I completed my PhD in spring 2022 from Iowa State University, USA. I was the proud recipient of [<span style="color: #00008B">**Karas Award**</span>](https://www.grad-college.iastate.edu/awards/karas/recipients/) of Iowa State University for the outstanding dissertation in Mathematical and Physical Science and Engineering in 2022. During my PhD, I have worked under the supervision of Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). My PhD dissertation that addresses different challenges in distributed computations can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">**here**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hfipcodbsg2b39r/PhD_dissertation_Anindya_Bijoy_Das.pdf?dl=0). 

My research interests include federated learning, distributed computation, deep machine learning, signal processing, AI/ML applications etc. More details can be can be found in my [<span style="color: #00008B">**CV**</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wTJRHPUz4a44isa8k0UzWPa40tzWfzMV/view?usp=drive_link)/[<span style="color: #00008B">**resume**</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jW8bDmD9B9E_Vsvk6Fn_6S8lKnPWyBlc/view?usp=drive_link).
