<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
I have completed my PhD in spring 2022 from the department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I have worked on straggler (slower worker node) mitigation in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). Specifically I have developed different novel schemes based on coding theory which can improve the numerical stability and enhance the speed of distributed computation in presence of stragglers. These methods can be directly incorporated into the framework of different deep learning or optimization methods which can make the overall systems significantly faster. 

My research interests include distributed computation, deep machine learning, signal processing, quantum computation etc. My detailed CV can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">here</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlraokzqoc5sm48/Anindya_Bijoy_Das_CV.pdf?dl=0).
