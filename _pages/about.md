<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
<div>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Purdue University working jointly with Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**David J. Love**</span>](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/) and Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**Christopher G. Brinton**</span>](https://www.cbrinton.net/) on federated learning and deep learning with applications in communications. As an investigator, I am also working on [<span style="color: #00008B">**AI tensor computations in edge network**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n7pppb9rhl7y14n/pes_aci.png?dl=0) for which we have been recently awarded a grant of $73,000 by Autonomous and Connected Systems of Purdue Engineering Initiatives.</div>

Before that I completed my PhD in spring 2022 from the department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I have worked on straggler (slower worker node) mitigation in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). My PhD dissertation can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">**here**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hfipcodbsg2b39r/PhD_dissertation_Anindya_Bijoy_Das.pdf?dl=0) where I have addressed the following issues on distributed computations-
* <span style="color:blue">**Numerical stability**</span> <br /> An approach based on Convolutional Codes <br /> Provides an upper bound for the worst case condition number <br /> Less recovery error in presence of noise or round-off error

* <span style="color:blue">**Sparse Input Matrices**</span> <br /> Worker computation is faster <br /> Incorporates less amount of coding

* <span style="color:blue">**Partial Stragglers**</span> <br /> An approach based on cyclic code <br /> Efficient utilization of the slower nodes


My research interests include distributed computation, federated learning, deep machine learning, signal processing etc. My detailed CV can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">**here**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlraokzqoc5sm48/Anindya_Bijoy_Das_CV.pdf?dl=0).
