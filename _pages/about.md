**About me**

I am presently a PhD candidate at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I am currently working on the straggler issue in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor Aditya Ramamoorthy. My research interests include coding theory, quantum computation, information theory, machine learning etc.
