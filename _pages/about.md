<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
I have completed my PhD in spring 2022 from the department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I have worked on straggler (slower worker node) mitigation in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). Specifically I have addressed the following issues on distributed computations-
* <span style="color:blue">**Ph.D. candidate**</span> in **Numerical stability** <br /> An approach based on Convolutional Codes <br /> Provides an upper bound for the worst case condition number <br /> Less recovery error in presence of noise or round-off error

* <span style="color:blue">**M. Eng.**</span> in **Sparse Input Matrices** <br /> Worker computation is faster <br /> Incorporates less amount of coding

* <span style="color:blue">**B. Sc.**</span> in **Partial Stragglers** <br /> An approach based on cyclic code <br /> Efficient utilization of the slower nodes


My research interests include distributed computation, deep machine learning, signal processing, quantum computation etc. My detailed CV can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">**here**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlraokzqoc5sm48/Anindya_Bijoy_Das_CV.pdf?dl=0).
