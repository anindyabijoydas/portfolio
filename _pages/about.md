<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
I am presently a PhD candidate at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I am currently working on straggler mitigation in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). 

My research interests include distributed computation, deep machine learning, signal processing, quantum computation etc. My detailed CV can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">here</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlraokzqoc5sm48/Anindya_Bijoy_Das_CV.pdf?dl=0).
