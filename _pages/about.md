<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Purdue University working jointly with Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**David J. Love**</span>](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/) and Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**Christopher G. Brinton**</span>](https://www.cbrinton.net/) on federated learning and deep learning with applications in different areas of communications. 

Before that I completed my PhD in spring 2022 from the department of Electrical & Computer Engineering in Iowa State University, USA. I have worked on straggler (slower worker node) mitigation in distributed computation under the supervision of Professor [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). My PhD dissertation can be found [<span style="color: #00008B">**here**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hfipcodbsg2b39r/PhD_dissertation_Anindya_Bijoy_Das.pdf?dl=0) where I have addressed different challenges in distributed computations which includes numerical stability, computation delay, partial stragglers etc.


My research interests include distributed computation, federated learning, deep machine learning, signal processing etc. More details can be can be found in my [<span style="color: #00008B">**CV**</span>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlraokzqoc5sm48/Anindya_Bijoy_Das_CV.pdf?dl=0)/[<span style="color: #00008B">**resume**</span>](https://github.com/anindyabijoydas/portfolio/blob/main/files/Anindya_Bijoy_Das_Resume.pdf).
