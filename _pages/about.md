<span style="color:brown">**About me**</span>
======
I am currently working as a tenure-track assistant professor in [<span style="color: #00008B">**The University of Akron**</span>](https://www.uakron.edu/) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). Here I am instructing different courses within the ECE department, while actively engaging in research across emerging fields.

I completed my PhD in spring 2022 from Iowa State University, USA. I was honored with the [<span style="color: #00008B">**Karas Award**</span>](https://www.grad-college.iastate.edu/awards/karas/recipients/) by Iowa State University in recognition of my outstanding dissertation in the field of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Engineering. During my PhD, I have worked under the supervision of Prof. [<span style="color: #00008B">**Aditya Ramamoorthy**</span>](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/) on different challenges in distributed computations. After my PhD, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the ECE department at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.  

My research interests include federated learning, different aspects of Large Language Models, distributed computation, security, federated learning, signal processing, AI/ML applications etc. More details can be can be found in my [<span style="color: #00008B">**CV**</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wTJRHPUz4a44isa8k0UzWPa40tzWfzMV/view?usp=drive_link).
